                    <p>A Jeffrey Epstein accuser has revealed that she twice warned the FBI about Donald Trump's connections to the convicted sex trafficker, raising new questions about what information may be contained in unreleased government files relating to the Epstein investigation. The revelation comes amid renewed scrutiny over the Trump administration's handling of pressure to release Epstein-related investigative files.</p>

                    <h3 id="accuser-account">Maria Farmer's Account and FBI Warnings</h3>
                    <p>Maria Farmer, an artist who was among the first women to report sexual crimes by Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell in 1996, told The New York Times that she specifically urged law enforcement to investigate Trump during interviews with the FBI in both 1996 and 2006. Farmer worked for Epstein in 1995 and 1996, initially acquiring art on his behalf before later overseeing the comings and goings of girls, young women and celebrities at the front entrance of his Upper East Side townhouse.</p>

                    <p>According to Farmer's account, the concerning incident that prompted her to mention Trump occurred in 1995, shortly after Epstein hired her to do artwork, when Epstein summoned her to his offices at the Helmsley Palace building late one night. Farmer, who was 25 at the time and wearing running shorts, said Trump arrived in a business suit and stood over her in what she described as an "imposing" and "predatory" manner.</p>

                    <div class="quote-block">
                        "He was looking at me like he was in on some secret or something. He was smirking... I made an ugly face which caused Trump to back off."
                        <br><strong>‚Äî Maria Farmer, describing the 1995 encounter</strong>
                    </div>

                    <p>When Epstein emerged from another room, he told Trump "she's not here for you" and escorted him to a different area. As they left, Farmer says she overheard Trump comment that he thought she was 16 years old. When she reported these crimes to the New York Police Department and then the FBI in 1996, she also identified Trump as someone authorities should examine due to his close relationship with Epstein.</p>

                    <p>Farmer also revealed that Epstein had joked about "inheriting" Trump after his 1992 divorce from Ivana Trump, saying Epstein told her: "You're going to see us together all the time, we're fixtures because in the divorce I inherited Trump and Ghislaine [Maxwell] inherited Ivana." She added, "It was a known thing among the staff and everyone, that they were best friends. And Epstein bragged about it."</p>

                    <h3 id="white-house-response">White House Denials and Legal Action</h3>
                    <p>The White House has categorically denied Farmer's account, with communications director Steven Cheung stating "The president was never in Epstein's office" and calling the allegations "recycled, old, fake news of the highest order that was already peddled by dying 'news organizations' like CNN more than six years ago." Cheung added that "this fake story was concocted by the Democrats and the liberal media, just like the Russiagate scandal."</p>

                    <div class="quote-block">
                        "He's lying. They're being disrespectful to the fact I have given up my entire life for this case, just to have it investigated. I'm really sorry for him, that he's caught... but he's lying, I don't appreciate it."
                        <br><strong>‚Äî Maria Farmer, responding to White House denials</strong>
                    </div>

                    <p>Trump has also taken legal action related to Epstein allegations, filing a defamation lawsuit reportedly worth over $10 billion against the Wall Street Journal over their report about a sexually suggestive birthday card he allegedly sent to Epstein. Trump called the Journal's article "false, malicious, and defamatory." The lawsuit also names the paper's owner Rupert Murdoch, parent companies Dow Jones and News Corp, and two Wall Street Journal reporters.</p>

                    <p>From a legal standpoint, law enforcement agencies have not accused Trump of any wrongdoing related to Epstein, and he has never been named as a target of any investigation. However, Farmer's account provides insight into how Trump's name may appear in unreleased investigative files, as such investigations typically explore a wide range of tips, evidence, and relationships.</p>

                    <h3 id="political-implications">Political Fallout and MAGA Base Reactions</h3>
                    <p>The controversy has created significant political turmoil, with MAGA outrage over the Epstein files boiling over after Trump's Justice Department announced no further evidence would be released, despite his campaign promise to release the files. This announcement unleashed turmoil among the president's MAGA supporter base.</p>

                    <p>Republican Senator Marsha Blackburn has been among those demanding transparency, stating: "The FBI has long been aware of Jeffrey Epstein's alleged human trafficking ring. Yet, they have failed to uphold their duty to the American people to properly investigate this horrific abuse and bring those who participated in it to justice."</p>

                    <div class="quote-block">
                        "If you tell the base of people who support you of deep state, treasonous crimes, election interference, blackmail, and rich, powerful elite evil cabals, then you must take down every enemy of the people, if not, the base will turn and there is no going back."
                        <br><strong>‚Äî Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, warning about MAGA base expectations</strong>
                    </div>

                    <p>House Republicans, including some of Trump's strongest allies, have signed onto bipartisan legislation that would force the release of Epstein files, though House Speaker Mike Johnson has blocked any votes until at least September. Meanwhile, Democrats have sought to seize on the political division and are pushing a petition that would force a binding floor vote on Epstein file release.</p>

                    <p>Conservative outlets like Fox News have focused their coverage on broader FBI failures in the Epstein case, with reports highlighting that "a dozen of Jeffrey Epstein's accusers have filed a lawsuit against the U.S. government alleging that the FBI failed to properly investigate the financier's sex-trafficking crimes as far back as the 1990s."</p>

                    <h3 id="conclusion">Justice Department Position and Ongoing Legal Challenges</h3>
                    <p>The Justice Department announced in July that it will not be releasing any more evidence about the Epstein investigation and stated in a two-page memo that there was no client list of elite figures who participated in Epstein's trafficking of underage girls. This announcement came despite Trump's earlier campaign promise to release Epstein files, adding to the controversy over transparency.</p>

                    <p>Additionally, Farmer has filed a federal lawsuit against the government in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, accusing the FBI, Justice Department, and U.S. Attorney's Office of negligence and failing to protect her and other Epstein accusers. The relationship between Trump and Epstein appeared to have been strained after a real estate dispute over a Palm Beach mansion in 2004, which may also be relevant to understanding their association.</p>

                    <div class="bias-rating">
                        <strong>BIAS RATING: SLIGHTLY LEFT-LEANING</strong><br>
                        While this article includes multiple perspectives and White House denials, the sourcing is predominantly from mainstream and left-leaning outlets (Guardian, NYT, CNN) with limited conservative perspective beyond Fox News coverage of FBI failures. The structural emphasis on the accuser's detailed account and emotional responses, combined with language like "MAGA outrage," tilts the coverage slightly leftward despite efforts to present both sides of the story.
