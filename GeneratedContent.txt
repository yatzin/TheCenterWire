Couple Slain While Hiking With Daughters in Arkansas State Park

Introduction
A tragic double homicide occurred in Devil’s Den State Park, Arkansas, when Clinton David Brink, 43, and Cristen Amanda Brink, 41, were killed while hiking with their two young daughters. The incident has shocked the local community and prompted a statewide manhunt for the suspect, whose identity remains unknown at this time (1).
Recent updates from Newsweek and ABC13 have provided additional details on the investigation. Authorities have now described the suspect as a white male, approximately 5'10" to 6'0" tall, medium build, with short brown hair and a trimmed beard, last seen wearing dark clothing and fingerless gloves. The suspect was reportedly driving a black Mazda sedan with obscured license plates (4, 5).
4029tv and Fox News further clarify the suspect’s appearance: a white male, medium build, wearing a long-sleeved shirt (sleeves rolled up), dark pants, dark baseball cap, sunglasses, black backpack, and fingerless gloves. He was seen driving a black four-door sedan, possibly a Mazda, with the license plate covered by electrical or duct tape, exiting onto State Highway 170 or 220 (6, 7).

Background
The Brinks had recently moved to Prairie Grove, Arkansas, from out of state, with records indicating previous residences in California and Montana. On Saturday afternoon, July 27, 2025, Arkansas State Police were notified of the double homicide. The couple’s daughters, ages 7 and 9, were unharmed and are now in the custody of family members. The crime took place on a remote trail in Devil’s Den State Park, an area known for its rugged terrain and lack of cellphone service. The park is a popular destination for hikers and outdoor enthusiasts, and all trails were closed following the incident (1).
Both sources emphasize the park’s rugged terrain, thick vegetation, and lack of cellphone service, which complicated the investigation (6, 7).
According to Newsweek, the investigation has expanded to include federal agencies, and police are reviewing surveillance footage from nearby roads and businesses. ABC13 reports that the suspect may have had prior knowledge of the park’s layout, suggesting possible premeditation (4, 5).

Stakeholder Perspectives
Public reaction has been one of shock, grief, and concern for safety. On Reddit, many users expressed condolences to the victims’ families and discussed the rarity of such violence in state parks. Some local residents reported feeling less safe and reconsidering outdoor activities, while others emphasized that such incidents are extremely rare compared to urban crime rates. There was also discussion about the suspect’s apparent premeditation, as the vehicle used to flee the scene had its license plate obscured with tape (Reddit).

Officials, including Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders, have assured the public that law enforcement is working tirelessly to apprehend the perpetrator. The Arkansas State Police described the suspect as a medium-built man wearing dark clothing and fingerless gloves, last seen driving a black sedan, possibly a Mazda. The investigation is ongoing, with authorities seeking any video footage or witness accounts from park visitors on the day of the crime (1).
The Brinks’ family released a statement asking for privacy and urging anyone with information to contact authorities, describing Clinton and Cristen as heroes who protected their daughters (6).
Officials from the Arkansas Department of Parks, Heritage and Tourism expressed condolences and noted increased law enforcement presence in state parks, emphasizing visitor safety (7).
Newsweek quoted the Arkansas State Police spokesperson, who stated, “We are following up on every lead and urge anyone with information to come forward.” ABC13 confirmed that the FBI has joined the investigation, and the Governor reiterated her commitment to public safety, saying, “We will not rest until justice is served for the Brink family” (4, 5).

Impacts & Implications
The incident has raised concerns about public safety in outdoor recreational areas, though statistical data cited by commenters shows that violent crime in state and national parks is exceedingly rare. The closure of Devil’s Den trails and the ongoing manhunt have disrupted local tourism and heightened anxiety among residents. The case has also prompted discussions about mental health, random violence, and the importance of community vigilance.
Investigators are asking park visitors to check any photos or videos for images of the suspect and to contact Arkansas State Police with information (6, 7).

Conclusion
The murders of Clinton and Cristen Brink have deeply affected their family, the local community, and the broader public. While the investigation continues, the focus remains on supporting the surviving children and bringing the perpetrator to justice. The event serves as a somber reminder of the unpredictability of violence, even in places considered safe.
