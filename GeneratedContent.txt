# Tennessee Woman Denied Prenatal Care for Being Unmarried, Sparking Debate Over Medical Ethics Law

## A 35-year-old woman's experience highlights the controversial implications of the Tennessee Medical Ethics Defense Act

JONESBOROUGH, Tenn. - At a town hall meeting in Jonesborough last Thursday, a 35-year-old Tennessee woman shared a story that has ignited widespread debate about healthcare access and religious freedom. The woman, who remains anonymous, was denied prenatal care by her physician solely because she was not married to her 15-year partner, with whom she has a 13-year-old child.

The denial of care occurred when the woman was approximately four weeks pregnant and seeking routine prenatal services. Her physician reportedly cited the 2025 Medical Ethics Defense Act as justification for refusing treatment based on their moral objections to her unmarried status.

## Background on the Medical Ethics Defense Act

The Medical Ethics Defense Act, signed into law by Republican Governor Bill Lee on April 24, 2025, represents Tennessee's entry into a growing national movement protecting healthcare providers' conscience rights. The legislation allows healthcare practitioners, institutions, and insurance companies to refuse participation in procedures, treatments, or services that violate their "sincerely held ethical, moral, or religious beliefs."

Tennessee became the 12th state to enact such comprehensive conscience protections, following states like Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Illinois, Mississippi, Montana, New Mexico, Ohio, South Carolina, and Washington. Idaho previously enacted a similar Medical Ethics Defense Act in March.

The bill passed along party lines in the Republican-controlled legislature, with the Senate approving it 27-3 and the House by a 71-22 margin. All Republicans supported the legislation while all Democrats opposed it.

## Stakeholder Perspectives

**Supporting Voices:**

Franklin Graham, president of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association, praised the law as "a huge step in the right direction," stating that "people should not be forced to choose between their faith and their livelihood."

Rep. Bryan Terry (R-Murfreesboro), the House sponsor and a physician himself, argued the measure protects healthcare providers from "moral injury," which he believes contributes to Tennessee's physician shortage. "Patients and providers have rights. Providers should not give up their rights to best serve their patients' [rights]," Terry said.

Dr. Jonathan Shaw, an OB-GYN who testified in support of the bill, shared his experience of nearly being forced out of his previous practice in the Northeast for refusing to announce his pronouns to patients, a policy that conflicted with his personal beliefs. Shaw said he was drawn to Tennessee because of the state's "common-sense policies which preserve the freedom to be guided by conscience as a physician."

Greg Chafuen, senior counsel for Alliance Defending Freedom's Center for Public Policy, argued that the law ensures "patients are best served by health care professionals who are free to act consistent with their oath to 'do no harm.'"

**Opposition Concerns:**

Rep. Gloria Johnson (D-Knoxville) criticized the law's application in this case, stating, "This is exactly what we said would happen when this law was passed. We're denying healthcare to women based on their personal lives."

Dr. Amy Gordon Bono, a Tennessee primary care physician, argued the measure contradicts the Hippocratic Oath, which requires doctors to prioritize their patients' well-being. "When legislation is not patient-centered, it's morally compromised to begin with," she said. "Politicians need to stop dictating medical care, and this bill allows politicians to take their intrusive efforts even further."

Rep. Sam McKenzie (D-Knoxville) expressed particular concern about emergency situations involving pregnancy complications, questioning whether doctors might use their beliefs to deny life-saving care during medical emergencies.

**Public Reaction:**

The story has generated significant discussion on social media platforms, particularly Reddit, where it received over 20,585 upvotes and 954 comments. Comments reflect widespread criticism of the policy, with many users expressing concern about the precedent of allowing personal beliefs to override medical care.

Users described the situation as "barbaric," "dystopian," and a violation of medical ethics. Many expressed concern that such policies could lead to discrimination against unmarried women and interfere with fundamental healthcare access.

## Legal Framework and Limitations

The Medical Ethics Defense Act includes specific limitations designed to balance conscience rights with patient safety:

- The conscience clause does not apply in emergency situations
- Insurance providers cannot invoke the clause if they are contractually obligated to cover specific treatments
- The law includes whistleblower protections for those who report violations
- It prohibits retaliation against healthcare providers for protected speech or expression

However, critics argue these limitations may not be sufficient to prevent discrimination in non-emergency situations, as demonstrated by the Jonesborough case.

## Broader Implications

This incident highlights the complex intersection of religious freedom, medical ethics, and patient access to care. Healthcare law experts note that such conscience clause legislation often creates tension between providers' religious beliefs and patients' healthcare needs.

The case also underscores the ongoing national debate over the scope of religious exemptions in healthcare settings. While supporters argue these protections are necessary to maintain a diverse healthcare workforce and protect religious liberty, opponents contend they can lead to discrimination and barriers to care.

The Alliance Defending Freedom reports that similar laws in other states are "rarely used and have never been challenged in court," suggesting that dramatic impacts may be limited. However, critics argue that even isolated cases of denied care represent unacceptable restrictions on healthcare access.

## Impact on Tennessee Healthcare

The incident raises questions about the practical implementation of Tennessee's Medical Ethics Defense Act and its potential effects on the state's healthcare landscape. While proponents argue the law will help retain healthcare providers who might otherwise leave due to moral conflicts, opponents worry it could create barriers to care, particularly for vulnerable populations.

Tennessee already faces challenges with healthcare access, particularly in rural areas, leading some to question whether policies that could further limit access are advisable. The state has seen ongoing debates over reproductive healthcare and LGBTQ+ rights, making this incident part of a broader cultural and political conversation.

## Conclusion

The case of the Tennessee woman denied prenatal care illustrates the real-world implications of conscience clause legislation. While the Medical Ethics Defense Act aims to protect healthcare providers' religious and moral convictions, critics argue it can result in discrimination and reduced access to care.

As similar legislation is considered in other states, the Tennessee experience provides a concrete example of how such laws operate in practice. The ongoing debate reflects broader national tensions over the balance between religious liberty and civil rights in healthcare settings.

The anonymous woman's story continues to circulate on social media and has been covered by news outlets ranging from the Nashville Banner to national publications, ensuring that this local incident contributes to the national conversation about healthcare access and religious freedom.
