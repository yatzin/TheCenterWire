Jeffrey Epstein Accuser Says She Urged FBI to Investigate Trump Decades Ago

A Jeffrey Epstein accuser has revealed that she twice warned the FBI about Donald Trump's connections to the convicted sex trafficker, raising new questions about what information may be contained in unreleased government files relating to the Epstein investigation.

Introduction

Maria Farmer, an artist who was among the first women to report sexual crimes by Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell in 1996, told The New York Times that she specifically urged law enforcement to investigate Trump during interviews with the FBI in both 1996 and 2006. Farmer's account comes amid renewed scrutiny over the Trump administration's handling of pressure to release Epstein-related investigative files, with some of the president's own Republican allies now demanding full transparency.

Background

Farmer worked for Epstein in 1995 and 1996, initially acquiring art on his behalf before later overseeing the comings and goings of girls, young women and celebrities at the front entrance of his Upper East Side townhouse. She alleges that during this period, she was sexually assaulted by both Epstein and Maxwell. When she reported these crimes to the New York Police Department and then the FBI in 1996, she also identified Trump as someone authorities should examine due to his close relationship with Epstein. Farmer told The New York Times she asked law enforcement to "broadly examine people in Epstein's circles," clarifying that she had "no evidence of criminal wrongdoing" by associates of Epstein but was concerned about the scope of his activities and network of famous friends.

According to Farmer's account, the concerning incident that prompted her to mention Trump occurred in 1995, shortly after Epstein hired her to do artwork, when Epstein summoned her to his offices at the Helmsley Palace building late one night. Farmer, who was 25 at the time and wearing running shorts, said Trump arrived in a business suit and stood over her in what she described as an "imposing" and "predatory" manner. She recalled feeling scared as Trump stared at her bare legs and looked at her "like he was in on some secret or something," describing him as "smirking." She said she made an "ugly face" which caused Trump to "back off." When Epstein emerged from another room, he told Trump "she's not here for you" and escorted him to a different area. As they left, Farmer says she overheard Trump comment that he thought she was 16 years old.

The White House has categorically denied Farmer's account, with communications director Steven Cheung stating "The president was never in Epstein's office" and calling the allegations "recycled, old, fake news of the highest order that was already peddled by dying 'news organizations' like CNN more than six years ago." Cheung added that "this fake story was concocted by the Democrats and the liberal media, just like the Russiagate scandal" and reiterated that "the president kicked him out of his club for being a creep."

Farmer responded forcefully to these denials, telling CNN: "He's lying. They're being disrespectful to the fact I have given up my entire life for this case, just to have it investigated. I'm really sorry for him, that he's caught... but he's lying, I don't appreciate it." She insisted, "He was absolutely at the offices, it was 9 o'clock at night and I thought it was inappropriate. But also, they were best friends at the time."

Farmer also revealed that Epstein had joked about "inheriting" Trump after his 1992 divorce from Ivana Trump, saying Epstein told her: "You're going to see us together all the time, we're fixtures because in the divorce I inherited Trump and Ghislaine [Maxwell] inherited Ivana." She added, "It was a known thing among the staff and everyone, that they were best friends. And Epstein bragged about it."

Trump has also taken legal action related to Epstein allegations, filing a defamation lawsuit reportedly worth over $10 billion against the Wall Street Journal over their report about a sexually suggestive birthday card he allegedly sent to Epstein. Trump called the Journal's article "false, malicious, and defamatory." The lawsuit also names the paper's owner Rupert Murdoch, parent companies Dow Jones and News Corp, and two Wall Street Journal reporters.

The controversy has created significant political turmoil, with MAGA outrage over the Epstein files boiling over after Trump's Justice Department announced no further evidence would be released, despite his campaign promise to release the files. This announcement unleashed turmoil among the president's MAGA supporter base.

Stakeholder Perspectives

The revelation has drawn strong reactions from across the political spectrum. Public sentiment on Reddit showed users expressing frustration with what they perceive as Trump's connections to individuals involved in serious crimes. One highly upvoted comment noted that "yet another person pardoned for January 6th was arrested for charges related to child porn last week, bringing the total up to 4 known pedophiles pardoned by Trump."

Conservative outlets like Fox News have focused their coverage on broader FBI failures in the Epstein case, with a February 2024 report highlighting that "a dozen of Jeffrey Epstein's accusers have filed a lawsuit against the U.S. government alleging that the FBI failed to properly investigate the financier's sex-trafficking crimes as far back as the 1990s."

Republican Senator Marsha Blackburn has been among those demanding transparency, stating: "The FBI has long been aware of Jeffrey Epstein's alleged human trafficking ring. Yet, they have failed to uphold their duty to the American people to properly investigate this horrific abuse and bring those who participated in it to justice."

Meanwhile, some of Trump's most loyal supporters, including Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, have warned the president that his base expects full disclosure. Greene posted on social media that "if you tell the base of people who support you of deep state, treasonous crimes, election interference, blackmail, and rich, powerful elite evil cabals, then you must take down every enemy of the people, if not, the base will turn and there is no going back."

Law enforcement perspectives emphasize the complex nature of such investigations. Jack Scarola, a lawyer who has represented nearly 20 women against Jeffrey Epstein, told CNN that "anyone associating with Jeffrey Epstein on a regular basis had to have been deaf, dumb and blind not to recognize the fact that something very unusual was going on in Jeffrey Epstein's relationship with young girls."

Impacts & Implications

The political implications are significant as Trump faces pressure from multiple directions. House Republicans, including some of his strongest allies, have signed onto bipartisan legislation that would force the release of Epstein files, though House Speaker Mike Johnson has blocked any votes until at least September. However, a largely symbolic effort by congressional Republicans to call on the administration to release Epstein documents has been put on hold.

Meanwhile, Democrats have sought to seize on the political division and are pushing a petition that would force a binding floor vote on Epstein file release. That effort has garnered some Republican support, indicating bipartisan interest in transparency. Republicans have generally coalesced behind Trump's criticisms of media reporting on Epstein connections.

Trump has addressed various topics on social media during this period, including sports team names and the release of Martin Luther King Jr. files. Meanwhile, pressure for Epstein file disclosure continues from both Republican and Democratic lawmakers.

From a legal standpoint, law enforcement agencies have not accused Trump of any wrongdoing related to Epstein, and he has never been named as a target of any investigation. However, Farmer's account provides insight into how Trump's name may appear in unreleased investigative files, as such investigations typically explore a wide range of tips, evidence, and relationships. The relationship between Trump and Epstein appeared to have been strained after a real estate dispute over a Palm Beach mansion in 2004, which may also be relevant to understanding their association.

The Justice Department announced in July that it will not be releasing any more evidence about the Epstein investigation and stated in a two-page memo that there was no client list of elite figures who participated in Epstein's trafficking of underage girls. This announcement came despite Trump's earlier campaign promise to release Epstein files, adding to the controversy over transparency.

Additionally, Farmer has filed a federal lawsuit against the government in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, accusing the FBI, Justice Department, and U.S. Attorney's Office of negligence and failing to protect her and other Epstein accusers.

The broader implications extend to questions about FBI investigative practices and transparency. The agency has faced criticism for its handling of the Epstein case, with accusations that it failed to adequately pursue leads and interview potential witnesses for over two decades.

Conclusion

Maria Farmer's revelations add another layer to the ongoing controversy surrounding the Epstein files and Trump's relationship with the convicted sex trafficker. While her account does not constitute evidence of criminal wrongdoing by Trump, it illustrates how his name came to be part of the federal investigation and why it may appear in unreleased government documents. The political pressure for transparency continues to build from both parties, suggesting this issue will remain prominent in American political discourse. As Farmer noted in her CNN interview, "I've waited three decades to be able to even be heard about this because the government has not held any of the people I reported accountable."
